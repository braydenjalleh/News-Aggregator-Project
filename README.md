This project is a Django based RESTful API and news aggregator application. It implements a web service for a news agency and allows interaction with other similar services developed by peers in the module. The system consists of:

* A RESTful API for managing news stories and authors.
* A client application to interact with the API, supporting login, posting, retrieving, and deleting news stories.
* A news aggregator that collects stories from multiple registered news agencies.
* Hosting and deployment of the web service on pythonanywhere.com.
